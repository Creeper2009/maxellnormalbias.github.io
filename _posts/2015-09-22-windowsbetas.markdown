title: "Collecting Windows Betas: Why I don't understand it"

I don't know why people collect Windows betas. It's baffling to me. I've asked this before, actually, on the #nttalk IRC channel. What I got was simply answers like "to explore the history". And this artice is about _why_ do you want to explore this history?

### Disclaimer

I don't hate any of you guys. I don't hate Windows, BetaArchive, WinworldPC or whatever you're from. In fact - if you can explain it to me, please <a href="mailto:0087yugbocaj@gmail.com">email me</a>. But hold off on the pitchforks for now.

### My criticisms

Betas such as Chicago, Whistler, and Longhorn are _very_ well documented. We've pretty much gotten every build from every development stage by now. Sites like _BetaWiki_ and _longhorn.ms_ are very thorough guides to pretty much every beta build. So, there's no need to install them in a virtual machine and "check them out".

And betas do not run well on actual hardware - or even do anything useful on a virtual machine. I was once discussing web browsers with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLd93VFZFwRR25nxKFks1bw">nerd73</a> and he told me he could get Firefox 3 to run on Longhorn... with **hacks**. So, if you're going to use a Windows OS in a virtual machine, why not use one that works?

And the only other reason I could ever think someone would collect something is sentimental value. There is no such thing as nostalgia for software that wasn't even released. There is no real emotional connection to Windows betas. If they were interesting or functional, this wouldn't be needed - but it's the last reason I can think of.

### What about new betas?

I don't know if most would consider this beta collecting, but looking at new betas for software that's about to come out is pretty interesting - it's _new_ content that isn't well documented yet, that's why you're there. And now, there's the Windows Insider Program, so you _can_ run them and check out every new facet of the OS.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, I guess I could simply say "I don't get it!" and call it a day. Because that's pretty much how I feel. But I'm open to learning new things - maybe some of the points covered in this post are flat-out wrong!

TL;DR: There is no TL;DR
