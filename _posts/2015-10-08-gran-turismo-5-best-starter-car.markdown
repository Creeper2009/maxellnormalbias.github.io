title: Gran Turismo 5 - My Starter Civic

Hello! I'm ntnick. I chat on #techtalk a lot and you can find me almost every day. I am a programmer and a video gamer on the PlayStation 3. Recently I got a copy of Gran Turismo 5 (GT5) and I started playing in GT Mode.

So, in GT Mode, you start of with a limited amount of credits and a level of 0.
You start off with about 20,000 credits, and you have to find a car that is within that price range.

So, what car did I pick? A Honda CIVIC TYPE R (EK) '97.

It only cost 19,980 credits, and it produced 187 HP, which is pretty great for a car of that price.

Since the little Civic was so light, it was pretty quick at the Sunday Cup races and easily got me into 1st place.

After I got enough money I tuned up the little car and it put out 200 HP!
This, of course, allowed me to do more races and get more prize cars.

One of the prize cars had an orange paint chip, so I could paint the Civic a nice orange color.
I wish I had a picture of it...

Anyways, that's all for now. Thanks for reading my terribly-put-together first-time blog post.
