<h1>Links</h1>
<p>Links to other sites that I think you should check out.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://tech-talk.ml">techTalk</a> is a forum I go on that's descended from the original OSFirstTimer forums.</li>
	<li><a href="http://grahamdowney.com">Ham62's site</a> is probably not what I'd consider well designed but it has some cool content if you enjoy retro software.</li>
	<li><a href="https://duckduckgo.com"">DuckDuckGo</a> is a secure search engine that allows you to quickly enter other commands to search on other sites. It's the only homepage you'll need!</li>
	<li><a href="http://toastytech.com">Toastytech</a> is another classic-looking site but it's fun to read.</li>
