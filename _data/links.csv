grahamdowney.com,is a pretty neat website if you're interested in old software...although it might crash your browser...or your eyes.,http://grahamdowney.com
DuckDuckGo,is a great search engine that is not only secure but allows you to quickly search other sites with !bang commands.,https://duckduckgo.com
Toastytech,is another classic website that's pretty out of date design-wise but it's still fun to read.,http://toastytech.com
Web Pages that Suck,shows you web pages that…well, suck. They're fun to laugh at. I'm a hypocrite - I disobey it's checklists. But they say personal sites don't have to, so whee!,http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/
