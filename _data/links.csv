techTalk,is a forum I go on that's descended from the original OSFirstTimer Forums. If you're viewing this site you're probably on it too.,http://tech-talk.ml
grahamdowney.com,is a pretty neat website if you're interested in old software...although it might crash your browser...or your eyes.,http://grahamdowney.com
DuckDuckGo,is a great search engine that is not only secure but allows you to quickly search other sites with !bang commands.,https://duckduckgo.com
Toastytech,is another classic website that's pretty out of date design-wise but it's still fun to read.,http://toastytech.com
